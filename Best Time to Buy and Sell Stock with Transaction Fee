You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

 

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices, int fee) {
        //hold[i] means we keep stock on i-th day
        //sold[i] means we didn't hold stock on i-th day
        int[] hold = new int[prices.length];
        int[] sold = new int[prices.length];
        //the first day, we hold it, but sold would be zero
        hold[0] = -prices[0];
        
        for(int i=1; i<prices.length; i++){
            hold[i] = Math.max(hold[i-1], sold[i-1]-prices[i]);
            sold[i] = Math.max(sold[i-1], hold[i-1]+prices[i]-fee);
        }
        
        return sold[sold.length-1];
    }
}
