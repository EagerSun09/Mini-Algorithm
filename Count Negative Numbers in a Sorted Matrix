Given a m x n matrix grid which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, return the number of negative numbers in grid.

class Solution {
    public int countNegatives(int[][] grid) {
        int col = grid[0].length;
        int res = 0;
        for(int[] g:grid){
            //if first less than 0, whole row less than 0
            if(g[0] < 0){
                res += col;
                continue;
            }
            //if last one bigger than 0, whole row bigger than 0
            if(g[col-1] >= 0){
                continue;
            }
            //binary search for the col that is less than 0
            int l = 0;
            int r =col-1;
            while(l < r){
                int mid = l + (r-l)/2;
                if(g[mid] < 0){
                    r = mid;
                }else{
                    l = mid + 1;
                }
            }
            res += (col - l);
        }
        
        return res;
    }
}
