You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.

Return the single element that appears only once.

Your solution must run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

class Solution {
    public int singleNonDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        //use binary search
        int l=0, r=nums.length-1;
        while(l < r){
            int mid = l +(r-l)/2;
            if(nums[mid] == nums[mid+1]){
                mid = mid -1;
            }
            //if left part has odd length, this means single element is in left part
            if((mid-l+1)%2 == 1){
                r = mid;
            }else{
                l = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return nums[l];
    }
}
