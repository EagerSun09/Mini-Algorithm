A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

class Solution {
    //using binary search
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int l=1,r=nums.length-1;
        if (nums.length <= 1) return 0;
        if (nums[0] > nums[1]) return 0;
        if (nums[r] > nums[r-1]) return r;
        r--;
        while(l < r){
            int mid = l + (r-l)/2;
            if(nums[mid-1]<nums[mid] && nums[mid]>nums[mid+1]){
                return mid;
            }else if(nums[mid-1]<nums[mid]){
                l = mid + 1;
            }else{
                r = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return l;
    }
}
