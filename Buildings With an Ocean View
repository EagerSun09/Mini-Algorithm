There are n buildings in a line. You are given an integer array heights of size n that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.

The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a smaller height.

Return a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.

class Solution {
    public int[] findBuildings(int[] heights) {
        //from right to left
        //if current is bigger than the highest on its right side, update highest and add current into answer
        int len = heights.length;
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        List<Integer> pq = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i=len-1; i>=0; i--){
            if(heights[i] > max){
                pq.add(i);
                max = heights[i];
            }else{
                continue;
            }
        }
        Collections.sort(pq);
        return pq.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).toArray();
    }
}
