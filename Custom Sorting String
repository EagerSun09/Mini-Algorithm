You are given two strings order and s. All the words of order are unique and were sorted in some custom order previously.

Permute the characters of s so that they match the order that order was sorted. More specifically, if a character x occurs before a character y in order, then x should occur before y in the permuted string.

Return any permutation of s that satisfies this property

class Solution {
    public String customSortString(String order, String s) {
        //first solution: using hashmap to store the order of chars, using priorityqueue to construct string
        HashMap<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i=0; i<order.length(); i++){
            map.put(order.charAt(i), i);
        }
        
        PriorityQueue<Character> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a,b) -> (map.getOrDefault(a,Integer.MAX_VALUE)-map.getOrDefault(b, Integer.MAX_VALUE)));
        
        for(int i=0; i<s.length(); i++){
            pq.add(s.charAt(i));
        }
        
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while(!pq.isEmpty()){
            sb.append(pq.poll());
        }
        
        return sb.toString();
        //second solution: using hashmap to contain chars and their frequencies, then walk through the order to add each of them and finally append
        //chars that are not in order
    }
}
