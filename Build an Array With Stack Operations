You are given an array target and an integer n.

In each iteration, you will read a number from list = [1, 2, 3, ..., n].

Build the target array using the following operations:

"Push": Reads a new element from the beginning list, and pushes it in the array.
"Pop": Deletes the last element of the array.
If the target array is already built, stop reading more elements.
Return a list of the operations needed to build target. The test cases are generated so that the answer is unique.

class Solution {
    public List<String> buildArray(int[] target, int n) {
        //count indicates the correct value
        int count = 1;
        //ans is the answer list
        List<String> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        int cur = 0;
        //we need to walk through whole list
        while(cur < target.length){
            //if we pop some values out, current value should be bigger than we expect
            if(target[cur] > count){
                //we keep adding push and pop until we the expect value is equal to current value in array
                while(target[cur] > count){
                    //keep adding words
                    ans.add("Push");
                    ans.add("Pop");
                    //expected value will be increased by 1
                    count++;
                }
                //current value will be pushed into array
                ans.add("Push");
                //current value will be increased by 1 and we move to next cell in the array
                cur++;
                //expected value will be increased by 1
                count++;
            }else{
                //otherwise, we just push the expectated value into the array
                ans.add("Push");
                count++;
                cur++;
            }
        }
        //return the answer
        return ans;
    }
}
