The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given an integer array nums, return the sum of Hamming distances between all the pairs of the integers in nums

class Solution {
    public int totalHammingDistance(int[] nums) {
        //every time we move bit to right 1 position and count number of elements that have 1 on the right most position
        //then get the total distance by multiplying the number of zeros and the number of ones
        int distance = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<32; i++){
            int countOnes = 0;
            for(int num:nums){
                countOnes += (num>>i)&1;
            }
            distance += countOnes * (nums.length - countOnes);
        }
        return distance;
    }
}
