//You are keeping score for a baseball game with strange rules. The game consists of several rounds, where the scores of past rounds may affect future rounds' scores.

//At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record. You are given a list of strings ops, where ops[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

//An integer x - Record a new score of x.
//"+" - Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores. It is guaranteed there will always be two previous scores.
//"D" - Record a new score that is double the previous score. It is guaranteed there will always be a previous score.
//"C" - Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record. It is guaranteed there will always be a previous score.
//Return the sum of all the scores on the record.
