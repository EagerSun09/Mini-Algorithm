Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area.
A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.

class Solution {
    public int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(int[][] points) {
        int[] ans = new int[points.length];
        //get x coordinates
        for(int i=0; i<ans.length; i++){
            ans[i] = points[i][0];
        }
        //from smallest to largest
        Arrays.sort(ans);
        //get largest interval
        int max = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<ans.length-1; i++){
            max = Math.max(max, ans[i+1]-ans[i]);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
