Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.
If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original

class Solution {
    public String reverseStr(String s, int k) {
        //conver to array
        char[] temp = s.toCharArray();
        int i=0;
        //walk through every 2k cells
        while(i < s.length()){
            helper(temp, i, Math.min(s.length()-1, i+k-1));
            i += 2*k;
        }
        
        return String.valueOf(temp);
    }
    
    public void helper(char[] temp, int left, int right){
        //swap first k cells
        while(left < right){
            char curR = temp[right];
            temp[right--]  = temp[left];
            temp[left++] = curR;
        }
    }
    
    
}
