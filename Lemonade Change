At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.

Given an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays, return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.



class Solution {
    public boolean lemonadeChange(int[] b) {
        //edge case, first is not legal
        if(b[0] != 5)
            return false;
        //indicate how many cash we have now
        int five=0, tens=0;
        for(int i=0; i<b.length; i++){
            //if get 5
            if(b[i] == 5){
                five++;
            }else if(b[i] == 10){
                //if get 10
                if(five<1){
                    return false;
                }else{
                    five--;
                    tens++;
                }
            }else{
                //if get 20, two choices: 1. 10+5 2.3*5
                if(tens>0 && five>0){
                    tens--;
                    five--;
                }else if(five>=3){
                    five-=3;
                }else
                    return false;
            }
