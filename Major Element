Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 

class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        int len = nums.length;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        //if a number appears more than n/2 times, the mide must be this number
        return nums[len/2];
    }
}
