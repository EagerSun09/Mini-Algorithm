Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        int x = 0;
        while(true){
            while(n>0){
                x += Math.pow(n%10, 2);
                n /= 10;
            }
            //base case for not happy
            if(x==4)
                return false;
            //if num is happy
            if(x==1)
                return true;
            n=x;
            x=0;
            
        }
    }
}
