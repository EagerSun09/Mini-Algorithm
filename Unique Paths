There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        //initialize the board
        int[][] ans = new int[m][n];
        //edge case, top row and leftmost column is 1
        for(int i=0; i<ans.length; i++){
            ans[i][0] = 1;
        }
        for(int i=0; i<ans[0].length; i++){
            ans[0][i] = 1;
        }
        //number of paths to current position based on the cell above it and the cell on the left side
        for(int i=1; i<ans.length; i++){
            for(int j=1; j<ans[0].length; j++){
                ans[i][j] = ans[i-1][j]+ans[i][j-1];
            }
        }
        
        return ans[m-1][n-1];
    }
}
