You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds.

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60. Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.

class Solution {
    public int numPairsDivisibleBy60(int[] time) {
        //complement of each duration
        int[] mod = new int[60];
        for(int t:time){
            mod[t%60]++;
        }
        //pair each time with its complement
        //if the summation between complements of two durations is 60, pair them
        int count = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<=30; i++){
            if(i==0 || i==30){
                if(mod[i]%2 == 0){
                    count += (mod[i]/2)*(mod[i]-1);
                }else{
                    count += mod[i]*((mod[i]-1)/2);
                }
                    
            }else{
                count += mod[i]*mod[60-i];
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
