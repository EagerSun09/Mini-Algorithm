We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.
Given an integer array nums, return the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.
A subsequence of array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

class Solution {
    public int findLHS(int[] nums) {
        //in ascending order
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        //result length
        int count = 0;
        //two pointer
        int left=0, right=1;
        while(right<nums.length){
            //diff between max and min now
            int diff = nums[right] - nums[left];
            if(diff==1){
                //if meeting constrain
                count = Math.max(count, right-left+1);
            }
            if(diff<=1){
                //if max is not big enough
                right++;
            }else{
                //is min is not big enough
                left++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
