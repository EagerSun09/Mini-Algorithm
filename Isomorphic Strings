Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

 


class Solution {
    public boolean isIsomorphic(String s, String t) {
    //using hashmap
        HashMap<Character, Character> map = new HashMap<>();
        int lenS = s.length();
        int lenT = t.length();
        //diff length means false
        if(lenS != lenT) return false;
        for(int i=0; i<lenS; i++){
            char a = s.charAt(i);
            char b = t.charAt(i);
            //if char in s has corresponding char in t
            if(map.containsKey(a)){
                if(map.get(a) != b)
                    return false;
            }else{
            //if char in t has corresponding char in s but s is not in hashmap
                if(map.containsValue(b))
                    return false;
                map.put(a,b);
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
