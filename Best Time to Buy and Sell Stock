Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        //store info we need
        int lowest = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int profit = 0;
        //walk through whole list
        for(int i=0; i<prices.length; i++){
            //get largest profit
            profit = Math.max(profit, prices[i] - lowest);
            //update lowest price
            if(prices[i]<lowest) lowest = prices[i];
        }
        
        return profit;
    }
}
