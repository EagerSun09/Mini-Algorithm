Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] g) {
        //count islands
        int count = 0;
        //start at each cell in g
        for(int i=0; i<g.length; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<g[0].length; j++){
                if(g[i][j] == '1'){
                    helper(g, i, j);
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
    
    public void helper(char[][] g, int x, int y){
        //if out of bound or meet water, exit
        if(x<0 || y<0 || x>=g.length || y>=g[0].length || g[x][y]=='0')
            return;
        //go to every adjacent island and mark it as water
        g[x][y] = '0';
        helper(g, x+1, y);
        helper(g, x, y+1);
        helper(g, x-1, y);
        helper(g, x, y-1);
    }
}
