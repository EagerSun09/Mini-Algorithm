A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"
To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, "11106" can be mapped into:

"AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
"KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)
Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be mapped into 'F' since "6" is different from "06".

Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

class Solution {
    //the number of decoding ways for i-th position depends on itself and previous number
    //if these two digit can be combined to form a number that in the rang [10,26], we difinitely need the number of
    //ways to decode previous i-2 numbers
    //using dp could help solve the problem
    public int numDecodings(String s) {
        int[] dp = new int[s.length()+1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = s.charAt(0)=='0'? 0:1;
        for(int i=2; i<dp.length; i++){
            int one = Integer.valueOf(s.substring(i-1,i));
            int two = Integer.valueOf(s.substring(i-2,i));
            if(0<one && one<=9){
                dp[i] += dp[i-1];
            }
            if(10<=two && two<=26){
                dp[i] += dp[i-2];
            }
        }
        return dp[dp.length-1];
    }
}
