You are given an array of logs. Each log is a space-delimited string of words, where the first word is the identifier.

There are two types of logs:

Letter-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of lowercase English letters.
Digit-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of digits.
Reorder these logs so that:

The letter-logs come before all digit-logs.
The letter-logs are sorted lexicographically by their contents. If their contents are the same, then sort them lexicographically by their identifiers.
The digit-logs maintain their relative ordering.
Return the final order of the logs.

class Solution {
    public String[] reorderLogFiles(String[] logs) {
        //use lambda function
        Arrays.sort(logs, (a, b)->(helper(a,b)));
        
        return logs;
    }
    
    public int helper(String a, String b){
        //check whether a and b is letter string
        int judgeA = a.indexOf(" ")+1;
        int judgeB = b.indexOf(" ")+1;
        boolean isLetterA = Character.isLetter(a.charAt(judgeA));
        boolean isLetterB = Character.isLetter(b.charAt(judgeB));
        //comapre them
        if(isLetterA && isLetterB){
            int cmp = a.substring(judgeA).compareTo(b.substring(judgeB));
            if(cmp != 0) return cmp;
            return a.compareTo(b);
        }else if(isLetterA && !isLetterB){
            return -1;
        }else if(!isLetterA && isLetterB){
            return 1;
        }else{
            return 0;
        }
    }
}
