A string s is called good if there are no two different characters in s that have the same frequency.

Given a string s, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make s good.

The frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the string "aab", the frequency of 'a' is 2, while the frequency of 'b' is 1.

class Solution {
    public int minDeletions(String s) {
        //first, get frequency of every character
        //then sort them
        //each time we get a duplicated frequency, decrease it by 1 and insert back to the heap
        int[] board = new int[26];
        for(char cur:s.toCharArray()){
            board[cur-'a']++;
        }
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a,b)->(b-a));
        for(int cur:board){
             if(cur==0){
                 continue;
             }
             maxHeap.add(cur);
        }
        int count = 0;
        while(maxHeap.size()>0){
            int cur = maxHeap.poll();
            if(maxHeap.size() == 0){
                return count;
            }
            if(cur == maxHeap.peek()){
                count++;
                if(cur > 1)
                    maxHeap.add(cur-1);
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
